Agentic Software Engineering
============================

https://ase.tools

About
-----

**Agentic Software Engineering (ASE)** is the opinionated companion
tooling of *Dr. Ralf S. Engelschall* for combining the approach of
*Agentic AI* into *Software Engineering* with the help of *Agentic
AI Coding Tools* like *Claude Code*. **ASE** primarily consists of a
*Claude Code* plugin and a Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool, including
an *MCP* service. **ASE** provides skills and commands to support
the most important, recurring work-steps in the primary disciplines
of *Software Engineering*, especially in the discipline *Software
Development*.

> [!NOTE]
> **ASE** is *agentic*, but not pure *agent*-based, i.e., it focuses
> on supporting the role of a software engineer with *Agentic AI* and
> not driving the disciple software engineering with fully autonomous
> agents.

> [!NOTE]
> Initially, the primary focus of **ASE** is on the Agentic AI Coding
> tool *Claude Code*. Later, a secondary focus could be also on the
> alternative tools *Github Copilot CLI*, *OpenAI Codex*, *Google Gemini
> CLI* or *OpenCode* &mdash; if their features support it.

> [!CAUTION]
> **ASE** is still under heavy development, still incomplete, partially
> broken and hence not ready for production use. If you are not a
> hard-boiled early adopter, please visit this project again, once we
> reached at least version 0.9.x!

Features
--------

**ASE** provides the following five distinct features:

- [**Configuration Scopes**](docs/configuration.md) (100% done):
  Parameters of project and agent can be configured on the hierarchy of
  the scopes *user*, *project*, *task*, and *skill*. This allows
  the flexible configuration of **ASE**.

- [**Session Constitution**](plugin/meta/ase-constitution.md) (80% done):
  All agent sessions have a "constitution" preloaded all the time, based
  on the configured parameters. This allows to control the *general*
  agent behavior.

- [**Task Skills**](plugin/skills/) (30% done):
  Recurring tasks are supported with dedicated skills, based on the
  configured parameters. This allows to control the *specific* agent
  behavior.

- **Context Gathering** (0% done):
  The agent context is loaded with individual information for all
  particular tasks. This allows the agent to more precisely perform the
  tasks.

- **Project Templates** (0% done):
  The agent is equipped with reasonable templates to scaffold
  Library/Framework, CLI and WebUI projects.
