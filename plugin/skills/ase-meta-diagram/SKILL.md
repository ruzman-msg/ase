Render Diagrams
===============

Your role is to render *every* diagram in the current session, with
*deterministic* and *clean* output. For this, your objective is to
produce a beautifully rendered diagram that the user can read directly
in the response text, derived from a *Mermaid* diagram specification,
which is rendered with the `diagram` tool of the `ase` MCP service.

Rules
-----

-   WHEN NOT:
    You *MUST* *NEVER* hand-draw diagrams under any circumstances!

    Box-drawing characters (`┌`, `│`, `└`, `┐`, `┘`, `─`, `┼`, `├`,
    `┤`, `┬`, `┴`, `╭`, `╰`), ASCII surrogates (`+`, `-`, `|`), or any
    other attempt to draw a framed shape token-by-token are *forbidden*
    as your own diagram output -— including when prose paragraphs are
    placed inside the frame (a tell-tale sign, since the `diagram` tool
    cannot place free text inside a subgraph).

-   WHEN:
    You *MUST* always use the `diagram` tool from the `ase` MCP service,
    whenever a diagram should be drawn!

    Every diagram in the output *MUST* originate from a `diagram`
    MCP tool call, with Mermaid diagram specification passed in the
    `diagram` field, made in the *same* session response turn. You
    *MUST* use a timeout of 20 seconds with the `diagram` MCP tool call
    and the MCP `timeout` facility.

-   INPUT:
    For describing the diagrams, you *MUST* use the *Mermaid* diagram
    specification language!

    Use the following diagram types per intent:
    -   *structure / layout / components / dependencies* → `flowchart TB`
    -   *control flow / branching / concurrency*         → `flowchart TB`
    -   *state machine / states / transitions*           → `stateDiagram-v2`
    -   *data flow / actors / messages / protocols*      → `sequenceDiagram`
    -   *data structure / classes / methods*             → `classDiagram`
    -   *data model / entities / relationships*          → `erDiagram`
    -   *metrics / distributions / time series*          → `xychart-beta`

-   OUTPUT:
    You *MUST* reproduce the `text` output of the `diagram` tool from the
    `ase` MCP service in the response text!

    In other words, after the `diagram` tool call completes, the
    skill *MUST* copy the tool's `text` result *verbatim* into a
    Markdown-fenced code block (triple backticks), directly placed
    in the response text immediately after the MCP tool call -— the
    user reads the Markdown fenced block in the response, not the
    (truncated) tool call display. Emitting only the tool call without
    the reproduction of the `text` output is a defect: the diagram is
    then effectively invisible.

-   NOTICE 1:
    You *MUST* *NEVER* emit the Mermaid diagram specification as a
    substitute for the rendered diagram output!

-   NOTICE 2:
    You *SHOULD* keep diagrams narrow!

    The renderer's horizontal extent scales with siblings per row,
    node label lengths, and inter-node padding. Hence, *always* use
    `flowchart TB` (top-to-bottom) -— never `LR`, `RL`, or `BT`
    (portrait beats landscape for terminals and code review diffs).
    Limit *≤6 siblings per row* and group further items into nested
    `subgraph` hierarchies; keep *node labels* *≤30 chars* (abbreviate
    long names, drop adjectives).

-   NOTICE 3:
    You *SHOULD* stack diagrams vertically!

    For *comparison diagrams* (e.g., *current vs. proposed*, *before
    vs. after*), render each side as a *separate* Mermaid diagram
    specification via the `diagram` tool from the `ase` MCP service, and
    then stack the two rendered blocks *vertically* -— each preceded by
    a bold label (`**BEFORE:**` / `**AFTER:**`, or similar). Do *not*
    attempt side-by-side layout.
