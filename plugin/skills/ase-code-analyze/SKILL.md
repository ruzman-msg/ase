Analyze Source Code
===================

<skill name="ase-code-analyze">
Analyze Source Code
</skill>

<role>
Your role is an experienced, *expert-level software developer*,
specialized in *analyzing source code*.
</role>

<objective>
*Analyze* the source code of $ARGUMENTS, and its directly related source
code, for problems in its *logic* and *semantics* and its related
*control flow*.
</objective>

<flow>

1.  <step id="STEP 1: Investigate Code Base">
    In this STEP 1, investigate on the code. If the code base is large,
    you *MUST* use the `Agent` tool (not inline work) to create multiple
    sub-agents to split the investigation task into appropriate chunks.

    Tenets:

    -   **Quiet Operation**:
        During investigation in this STEP 1, do *not* output anything else,
        especially do not give any further explanations or information.

    -   **Practical Relevance Only**:
        Focus on *practically relevant* cases and especially do *not*
        investigate on theoretical or fictive cases.

    -   **Problem Focus Only**:
        Still focus on the *problem only* and do *not* already
        investigate on any possible *solution*.
    </step>

2.  <step id="STEP 2: Show Results">
    In this STEP 2, for every detected problem, immediately report it
    with the following output <template/>, based on concise bullet
    points.

    <template>
    &#x1F7E0; PROBLEM (Severity: **<severity/>**): **P<n/>**: **<title/>**

    <description/>
    </template>

    Hints:

    -   For the final results, do *not* output anything else, especially do
        *not* give any further explanations or information.

    -   Uniquely identify the problems with `P<n/>` where <n/> is 1, 2, ...

    -   In <description/>, use *ultra brief* but still as *precise* as
        possible problem descriptions.

    -   In <description/>, highlight *code* as <template>`<code/>`</template>
        and *key aspects* as <template>*<aspect/>*</template>.

    -   In <description/>, add inline *references* to the related
        code positions in the form of either
        <template>(`<filename/>:<line-number/>`)</template>,
        <template>(`<filename/>:<line-number/>-<line-number/>`)</template> or
        <template>(`<filename/>#<function-or-method/>`)</template>.

    -   In <description/>, classify the problem with a <severity/>
        of <template>LOW</template>, <template>MEDIUM</template> or
        <template>HIGH</template>.

    -   *Additionally*, first call the `kv_clear()` tool of the `ase`
        MCP service to clear the in-memory key/value store, and then, for
        *every* reported problem, persist its problem analysis result
        via the `kv_set` tool of the `ase` MCP service, using `key` set
        to `ase-issue-P<n/>` and `val` set to `<title/>: <description/>`.
    </step>

3.  <step id="STEP 3: Give Final Hint">
    Finally, in this STEP 3, output the following <template/> to give a
    final hint:

    <template>
    ⧉ **ASE**: ☻ skill: **<skill-name/>**, ▶ status: **skill finished**
    ⧉ **ASE**: ↪ hint: **For deeper analysis, suggestions on solution approaches and then final problem resolution, use `/ase-code-resolve P{n}` in the same or even a different session.**
    </template>
    </step>

</flow>
