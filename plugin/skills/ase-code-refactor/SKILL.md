Refactor Artifacts
==================

Your role is an experienced, *expert-level software developer*.

<objective>
*Refactor* existing artifacts the following way:
<request>$ARGUMENTS</request>
</objective>

<flow>
1.  <step id="STEP 1: Reason About Refactoring">
    1.  Enter *Plan Mode* with the `EnterPlanMode` tool.

    2.  Clear any old plans of the *Plan Mode* and start planning from
        scratch with an empty plan.

    3.  If <request/> has the format `<id/>: <text/>` where <id/> matches
        the regexp `^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$`, then set
        <request><text/></request> and <ase-task-id><id/></ase-task-id>
        and call the `task_id(id: <ase-task-id/>, session:
        <ase-session-id/>)` tool from the `ase` MCP service to
        implicitly switch the task.

    4.  Report the task and request with the following <template/>:

        <template>
        ⧉ **ASE**: ◉ task: **<ase-task-id/>**
        ⧉ **ASE**: ◉ request: **<request/>**
        </template>

    5.  Figure out what the artifact refactoring <request/> is about.

    6.  Ask the user for clarification if the goal of this refactoring is
        too unclear.

    7.  Do not output anything in this step, except you asked the user.
    </step>

2.  <step id="STEP 2: Investigate Code Base">
    1.  Check the existing source files for all code which is related to the
        refactoring <request/>.

    2.  Check the architecture of the existing code base to understand the
        overall structures and dynamics.

    3.  Do not output anything in this step.
    </step>

3.  <step id="STEP 3: Find Refactoring Approaches">
    *Propose* corresponding *refactoring approach*, including
    optionally, some *alternative* refactoring approaches.

    Annotate the approach you recommend with an <annotation/> of ` ⚝
    **RECOMMENDATION** ⚝`. Report each approach with the following
    <template/> and do not output anything else in this step:

    <template>
    &#x1F535; **APPROACH A<n/>**<annotation/>: *<summary/>*
    - [...]
    - [...]
    - [...]
    <optional-diagram/>
    </template>

    Hints:

    -   Give a short one-sentence <summary/> of the refactoring approach plus
        *precise* and *brief* refactoring information. Try to keep the
        number of bullet points in the range of 1-4.

    -   In case of a *complex refactoring situation* only, visualize it with
        an optional diagram <optional-diagram/> by invoking the
        `ase-meta-diagram` skill via the `Skill` tool. For *current vs.
        proposed* comparisons, render each side as a *separate*
        `ase-meta-diagram` invocation and stack the rendered blocks
        *vertically* (labels `**Before:**` / `**After:**`); never
        side-by-side. Omit <optional-diagram/> entirely for simple or
        purely local situation.

    *Recommended* Tenets (generic):

    -   **Surgical Changes**:
        Keep source code changes always as small as possible.

    -   **Separation of Concerns**:
        Clearly separate all individual concerns as good as possible.

    -   **Single Responsibility Principle**:
        Every module, class, or function should have only one reason to change.

    -   **Behavior Preservation**:
        Refactoring changes only re-structure, never change any observable behavior.

    -   **Align with Code Base**:
        Strictly align with the existing code base by exactly following its
        coding style, its structure, its naming conventions, etc.

    *Essential* Tenets (specific):

    -   **Boy Scout Rule**:
        After the refactoring, leave the code base cleaner than you found it.

    -   **High Cohesion, Low Coupling**:
        Strike for a set of small, focused parts (high cohesion) connected by
        thin, explicit wires (low coupling).
    </step>

4.  <step id="STEP 4: Choose Refactoring Approach">
    Let the *user interactively choose* the preferred refactoring approach A<n/>
    with the help of the `AskUserQuestion` tool. Use *single-selection* only
    and provide small *code change previews*. Mark your recommended
    refactoring approach with ` ⚝ **RECOMMENDATION** ⚝` here again.
    Except for the interactive selection, do not output anything in this step.
    </step>

5.  <step id="STEP 5: Write Refactoring Plan">
    *Write a refactoring plan* for the chosen refactoring A<n/> by
    closely aligning to the existing architecture and the existing
    code base. Use the following <template/> for the plan and inject
    the information from refactoring A<n/> and all derived realization
    decisions into it:

    <template>

    # ✪ REFACTORING: **<title/>**

    ⚑ task id: **<ase-task-id/>** | ✳ created: **<timestamp-created/>** | ✎ modified: **<timestamp-modified/>**

    ## CONTEXT

    - **WHAT**: <summary-what/>

    - **WHY**: <summary-why/>

    ## CHANGES:

    - [...]

    - [...]

    - [...]

    ## VERIFICATION:

    - [...]

    - [...]

    - [...]

    </template>

    Hints:

    -   In all descriptions, highlight *code* as
        <template>`<code/>`</template> and *key aspects* as
        <template>*<aspect/>*</template>.

    -   For <summary-what/> and <summary-why/> use *ultra brief* but
        as *very precise* as possible description of the overall change. In
        <summary-what/> tell what is changed. In <summary-why/> tell why it
        is changed, or what benefit results.

    -   The <timestamp-created/> is the timestamp when this artifact refactoring specification
        was created. The <timestamp-modified/> is the timestamp when
        this feature specification was last modified. Both use a
        ISO-style format value, which has to be determined by calling
        the `timestamp(format: "yyyy-LL-dd HH:mm")` tool of the `ase`
        MCP service and use the `text` field of its response.

    -   The <title/> is a short summary of the <summary-what/>, no longer than
        50 characters.

    -   The sections `CHANGES` and `VERIFICATION` all are just a short
        list of 1-5 bullet points. Each bullet points is formatted as
        `- **<aspect/>**: <specification/>` where <aspect/> indicates
        the aspect of the section and <specification/> is 1-3 sentences
        giving a *ultra precise* but also *ultra brief* and *ultra concise*
        description of the aspect.

    -   In all sections, break all lines with a newline character
        after about 120 characters per line.

    You then *MUST* *save* the resulting plan content with the
    `task_save` tool (`id` set to <ase-plan-id/>, `text` set to the
    plan content) and then you *MUST* exit the *Plan Mode* with the
    `ExitPlanMode` tool.

    Finally, output a final hint with the following <template/>
    and do not output anything else in this step:

    <template>
    ✔ **RESULT**: Artifact Refactoring Plan Created.
    ▶ **NEXT**: `ase-task-edit`, `ase-task-preflight`, or `ase-task-implement`.
    </template>

    <expand name="next-step" arg1="ase-code-refactor">
        { label: "Skill: ase-task-edit",      description: "Edit the task plan again." },
        { label: "Skill: ase-task-preflight", description: "Preflight the task plan (non-destructive)." },
        { label: "Skill: ase-task-implement", description: "Implement the task plan (destructive)." }
    </expand>
    </step>
</flow>
