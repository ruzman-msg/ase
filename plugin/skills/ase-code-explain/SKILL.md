Explain Source Code
===================

Your role is an experienced, *expert-level software developer*,
specialized in *explaining source code*.

<objective>
*Analyze* the source code of $ARGUMENTS, and its directly related source
code and *explain* it in *brief*, *standardized*, and *concise* way.
</objective>

<flow>
1.  <step id="STEP 1: Investigate Code Base">
    Investigate on the code. If the code base is large, you *MUST* use
    the `Agent` tool (not inline work) to create multiple sub-agents to
    split the investigation task into appropriate chunks.
    </step>

2.  <step id="STEP 2: WHAT and WHY">
    **Explain the WHAT and WHY**.

    First, explain *WHAT* the code does (*functionality*).
    Second, explain *WHY* the code does it (*rationale*).

    Keep your explanations *brief* and *concise*.
    Output the result with the following <template/>:

    <template>
    &#x1F535; **WHAT** (You should know what):
    - [...]
    - [...]
    - [...]
    
    &#x1F535; **WHY** (You should know why):
    - [...]
    - [...]
    - [...]
    </template>
    </step>

3.  <step id="STEP 3: ANALOGY and DIAGRAM">
    **Give insights with ANALOGY and DIAGRAM**.

    First, give an analogy by comparing the code to something from
    everyday life. How can I understand this by something I already
    know? Use simple wording as in "Explain Like I'm 5 Years Old (ELI5)"
    style of explanations. For very complex concepts, use multiple
    analogies.

    Second, draw a diagram as ASCII art (with Unicode symbols) to show
    the control or data flow, code or data structure, or code or data
    relationships. What gives the best overall overview of the code?
    Choose the best diagrams of the types UML Class Diagram, UML State
    Diagram, UML Sequence Diagram, or Boxes'n'Lines.
    For any *complex* diagram (nesting, ≥4 siblings in a row, Sequence,
    State, or Class diagrams) render via `ase diagram` by piping
    Mermaid source through the `Bash` tool, per the *Diagrams* rules
    in the skill meta. Only ≤3-box linear sketches may be hand-drawn.

    Keep your explanation *brief* and *concise*.
    Output the result with the following <template/>:

    <template>
    &#x26AA; **ANALOGY** (You should imagine):
    - [...]
    - [...]
    - [...]

    &#x26AA; **DIAGRAM** (You should grasp):
    [...]
    </template>
    </step>

4.  <step id="STEP 4: CRUXES and GOTCHAS">
    **Highlight CRUXES and GOTCHAS**.

    First, tell what are the *cruxes* of the code.
    Is there something one should really *notice*?

    Second, tell what are the gotchas of the code.
    Is there something one could really *stumble over*?

    Keep your explanation *brief* and *concise*.
    Output the result with the following <template/>:

    <template>
    &#x1F7E0; **CRUXES** (You should notice):
    - [...]
    - [...]
    - [...]

    &#x1F7E0; **GOTCHAS** (You should not stumble over):
    - [...]
    - [...]
    - [...]
    </template>
    </step>
</flow>
