From scratch *craft* the following feature:
<feature><getopt-arguments/></feature>
</objective>

@${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../meta/ase-plan.md

Procedure
---------

You *MUST* follow the following numbered items *strictly* *sequentially*!
You *MUST* not skip any numbered item during processing!

You *MUST* *NOT* output anything in this entire procedure, *except* when
explicitly requested by this procedure via outputs based on a <template/>!

You *MUST* *NOT* call `Edit`, `Write`, `NotebookEdit`, or any
filesystem-modifying tool during this entire skill. The *only*
permitted way to persist artifacts is via `task_save(...)`.

1.  **Reason About Feature**:

    1.  <if condition="
            <feature/> matches the regexp `^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*$`
        ">
        Set <ase-task-id><feature/></ase-task-id> (set task id to feature)
        and <feature></feature> (set feature empty), call the
        `task_id(id: <ase-task-id/>, session: <ase-session-id/>)` tool
        from the `ase` MCP service to switch the task, and then only
        output the following <template/>:

        <template>
        ⧉ **ASE**: ◉ task: **<ase-task-id/>**, ▶ status: **task given**
        </template>
        </if>

    2.  If <feature/> has the format `<id/>: <text/>` where <id/> matches
        the regexp `^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$`, then set
        <feature><text/></feature> and <ase-task-id><id/></ase-task-id>
        and call the `task_id(id: <ase-task-id/>, session:
        <ase-session-id/>)` tool from the `ase` MCP service to
        implicitly switch the task. Do not output anything.

    3.  If <feature/> is empty,
        ask the user interactively, without a special tool, for the
        initial feature with a single question:

        `**No feature known yet. What is the feature you want to craft?**`

        Then set <feature/> to the response of the user.

    4.  <if condition="
            <ase-task-id/> is equal `default` and
            <feature/> is not empty
        ">
        Set <ase-task-id/> to a unique task id, derived from <feature/>,
        which consists of two lower-case words concatenated with a
        `-` character. Then call the `task_id(id: <ase-task-id/>,
        session: <ase-session-id/>)` tool from the `ase` MCP service to
        implicitly switch the task. Do not output anything.
        </if>

    5.  Report the task and feature with the following <template/>:

        <template>
        ⧉ **ASE**: ◉ task: **<ase-task-id/>**
        ⧉ **ASE**: ⇌ feature: **<feature/>**
        </template>

    6.  Figure out what the requested <feature/> to be crafted is about.

    7.  Ask the user for clarification if the goal of this crafting is too
        unclear.

    8.  Do not output anything in this step, except you asked the user.

2.  **Investigate Code Base**:

    1.  Check the existing source files for all code which is related to the
        requested new <feature/>.

    2.  Check the architecture of the existing code base to understand the
        overall structures and dynamics.

    3.  Do not output anything in this step.

3.  **Internalize Crafting Tenets**:

    You *MUST* internalize and honor the following tenets when crafting the new feature.
    Do not output anything.

    1.  Generic Tenets:

        -   **Separation of Concerns**:
            Clearly separate all individual concerns as good as possible.

        -   **Code Base Alignment**:
            Strictly align with the existing source code base by exactly
            following its coding style, its structure, its naming
            conventions, etc.

    2.  Specific Tenets:

        -   **Surgical Changes**:
            Keep source code changes always as small as possible.

        -   **Clear Minimal Scope**:
            Establish explicit boundaries for the new feature.
            Avoid feature scope creep and over-engineering.

        -   **Keep it Simple, Stupid (KISS)**:
            Build with the simplest design that solves the real problem.
            Avoid over-engineering.

        -   **You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)**:
            Build for today's actual needs, not speculative futures.
            Avoid premature optimizations, premature abstractions,
            over-configurability, etc.

        -   **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)**:
            Avoid redundancies, but honor the *Rule of Three*: Don't
            abstract on the first occurrence -- tolerate (small)
            duplication on the second -- factor out on the third only.

        -   **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**:
            Every module, class, or function should have only one reason
            to change.

        -   **Loose Coupling, High Cohesion**:
            Strike for good modularity by a set of small, focused parts
            (high cohesion), connected by thin, explicit wires and
            interfaces (loose coupling).

        -   **Clear Interfaces**:
            Design clear interfaces, contracts, and data models --
            with high attention to boundaries and modularity.

        -   **Non-Functional Requirements**:
            Honor the non-functional requirements Performance, Security,
            Scalability, Comprehensibility.

4.  **Find Feature Crafting Approaches**:

    You *MUST* perform the following sub-steps *internally* and *without
    any output* until and including the recommendation decision. Only
    sub-step 4 below is allowed to produce output.

    1.  *Propose* corresponding *feature approach*, including optionally,
        some *alternative* feature approaches. Do *not* output anything
        in this sub-step.

    2.  *Reflect* on and *critique* the proposed approaches by deriving,
        per approach, a small set of concrete *pros* and *cons*. Do
        *not* output anything in this sub-step.

    3.  Based on the reflection, *decide* which approach to recommend
        and annotate it with an <annotation/> of
        ` ⚝ **RECOMMENDATION** ⚝`. All other approaches receive an
        empty <annotation/>. Do *not* output anything in this sub-step.

    4.  Indicate start of reporting by showing the following <template/>:

        <template>
        ⧉ **ASE**: ┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈────────━━━━━━━━**(** `APPROACHES-BEGIN` **)**━━━━━━━━────────┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈
        </template>

    5.  Now report each approach with the following <template/>,
        inlining its pros/cons derived in sub-step 2:

        <template>
        ● **APPROACH A<n/>**<annotation/>: *<summary/>*
        ○ [...]
        ○ [...]
        ○ [...]
        ⊕ *pro*: [...]
        ⊖ *con*: [...]
        <optional-diagram/>
        </template>

        Hints:

        -   Give a short one-sentence <summary/> of the feature approach plus
            *precise* and *brief* feature information. Try to keep the
            number of bullet points (●) in the range of 1-4.

        -   In case of a *complex feature situation* only, visualize
            it with an optional diagram <optional-diagram/> by building
            a Mermaid specification <mermaid-spec/> (e.g. `flowchart
            TB`, `stateDiagram-v2`, `sequenceDiagram`, `classDiagram`,
            or `erDiagram`, depending on intent) and invoking the
            `ase-meta-diagram` skill by calling the tool `Skill(skill:
            "ase:ase-meta-diagram", args: <mermaid-spec/>)`. For
            *current vs. proposed* comparisons, render each side as
            a *separate* `ase-meta-diagram` invocation and stack the
            rendered blocks *vertically* (labels `**Before:**` /
            `**After:**`); never side-by-side. Omit <optional-diagram/>
            entirely for simple or purely local situation.

    6.  Indicate end of reporting by showing the following <template/>:

        <template>
        ⧉ **ASE**: ┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈────────━━━━━━━━**(**  `APPROACHES-END`  **)**━━━━━━━━────────┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈
        </template>

5.  **Choose Feature Crafting Approach**:

    1.  If <getopt-option-auto/> is equal `false`:
        Let the *user interactively choose* the preferred feature
        approach A<n/> with the help of the <user-dialog-tool/> tool.
        Use the header `Select Approach`, use `A<n/>: <short-summary/>`
        for the option (where <short-summary/> is an ultra brief summary
        of the approach A<n/>), and *single-selection* only and provide
        small *code change previews*. Mark your recommended feature
        approach with ` ⚝ **RECOMMENDATION** ⚝` here again.

    2.  If <getopt-option-auto/> is equal `true`:
        Set <n/> to the number of the feature approach A<n/> you recommend.
        Output a hint with the following <template/>:

        <template>
        ⧉ **ASE**: ◉ task: **<ase-task-id/>**, ▶ status: **auto-chosen approach A<n/>**
        </template>

6.  **Compose Feature Crafting Plan**:

    1.  *Compose a feature plan* for the chosen feature A<n/> by
        closely aligning to the existing architecture and the existing
        code base. Use the <format/> defined for a task plan and inject
        the information from feature A<n/> and all derived realization
        decisions into it. Store the resulting task plan in <content/>.

        You *MUST* *NOT* call `Edit`, `Write`, `NotebookEdit`, or any
        filesystem-modifying tool during this step.

    2.  Call the `timestamp(format: "yyyy-LL-dd HH:mm")` tool of the
        `ase` MCP service and use the `text` field of its response for
        <timestamp-created/> and <timestamp-modified/> information. Then
        insert the current <ase-task-id/>, <timestamp-created/>, and
        <timestamp-modified/> information and calculate the number of
        words <words/> of <content/>.

    3.  You *MUST* *save* the resulting plan content with the
        `task_save(id: <ase-task-id/>, text: <content/>)`.

    4.  Output a hint with the following <template/>:

        <template>
        ⧉ **ASE**: ◉ task: **<ase-task-id/>**, ✪ plan: **<words/>** words, ▶ status: **plan created**
        </template>

    5.  Directly pass-through control to the `ase:ase-task-edit` skill.
        Set <args></args> (set args to empty). If <getopt-option-next/>
        is not equal `none`, set <args><args/> --next
        <getopt-option-next/></args> (append to args). Then call the
        tool `Skill(skill: "ase:ase-task-edit", args: <args/>)`.
