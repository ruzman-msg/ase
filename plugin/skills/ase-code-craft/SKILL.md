Craft Feature
=============

Your role is an experienced, *expert-level software developer*.

From scratch *craft* the following feature:
<feature>$ARGUMENTS</feature>

@${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../meta/ase-plan.md

Procedure
---------

You *MUST* follow the following numbered items *strictly* *sequentially*!
You *MUST* not skip any numbered item during processing!

You *MUST* *NOT* output anything in this entire procedure, *except* when
explicitly requested by this procedure via outputs based on a <template/>!

1.  **Reason About Feature**:

    1.  <if condition="
            <feature/> matches the regexp `^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*$`
        ">
        Set <ase-task-id><feature/></ase-task-id> (set task id to feature)
        and <feature></feature> (set feature empty), call the
        `task_id(id: <ase-task-id/>, session: <ase-session-id/>)` tool
        from the `ase` MCP service to switch the task, and then only
        output the following <template/>:

        <template>
        ⧉ **ASE**: ◉ task: **<ase-task-id/>**, ▶ status: **task given**
        </template>
        </if>

    2.  If <feature/> has the format `<id/>: <text/>` where <id/> matches
        the regexp `^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$`, then set
        <feature><text/></feature> and <ase-task-id><id/></ase-task-id>
        and call the `task_id(id: <ase-task-id/>, session:
        <ase-session-id/>)` tool from the `ase` MCP service to
        implicitly switch the task.

    3.  If <feature/> is empty,
        ask the user interactively, without a special tool, for the
        initial feature with a single question:

        `**No feature known yet. What is the feature you want to craft?**`

        Then set <feature/> to the response of the user.

    4.  Report the task and feature with the following <template/>:

        <template>
        ⧉ **ASE**: ◉ task: **<ase-task-id/>**
        ⧉ **ASE**: ⇌ feature: **<feature/>**
        </template>

    5.  Figure out what the requested <feature/> to be crafted is about.

    6.  Ask the user for clarification if the goal of this crafting is too
        unclear.

    7.  Do not output anything in this step, except you asked the user.

2.  **Investigate Code Base**:

    1.  Check the existing source files for all code which is related to the
        requested new <feature/>.

    2.  Check the architecture of the existing code base to understand the
        overall structures and dynamics.

    3.  Do not output anything in this step.

3.  **Find Feature Crafting Approaches**:

    1.  *Propose* corresponding *feature approach*, including optionally,
        some *alternative* feature approaches.

    2.  Annotate the approach you recommend with an <annotation/> of
        ` ⚝ **RECOMMENDATION** ⚝`.

    3.  Report each approach with the following <template/>:

        <template>
        &#x1F535; **APPROACH A<n/>**<annotation/>: *<summary/>*
        - [...]
        - [...]
        - [...]
        <optional-diagram/>
        </template>

        Hints:

        -   Give a short one-sentence <summary/> of the feature approach plus
            *precise* and *brief* feature information. Try to keep the
            number of bullet points in the range of 1-4.

        -   In case of a *complex feature situation* only, visualize it with
            an optional diagram <optional-diagram/> by invoking the
            `ase-meta-diagram` skill via the `Skill` tool. For *current vs.
            proposed* comparisons, render each side as a *separate*
            `ase-meta-diagram` invocation and stack the rendered blocks
            *vertically* (labels `**Before:**` / `**After:**`); never
            side-by-side. Omit <optional-diagram/> entirely for simple or
            purely local situation.

        *Recommended* Tenets (generic):

        -   **Surgical Changes**:
            Keep source code changes always as small as possible.

        -   **Separation of Concerns**:
            Clearly separate all individual concerns as good as possible.

        -   **Single Responsibility Principle**:
            Every module, class, or function should have only one reason to change.

        -   **Behavior Preservation**:
            Refactoring changes only re-structure, never change any observable behavior.

        -   **Align with Code Base**:
            Strictly align with the existing code base by exactly following its
            coding style, its structure, its naming conventions, etc.

        *Essential* Tenets (specific):

        -   **High Cohesion, Low Coupling**:
            Strike for a set of small, focused parts (high cohesion) connected by
            thin, explicit wires (low coupling).

4.  **Choose Feature Crafting Approach**:

    1.  Let the *user interactively choose* the preferred feature approach A<n/>
        with the help of the <user-dialog-tool/> tool. Use *single-selection* only
        and provide small *code change previews*. Mark your recommended
        feature approach with ` ⚝ **RECOMMENDATION** ⚝` here again.

5.  **Write Feature Crafting Plan**:

    1.  *Write a feature plan* for the chosen feature A<n/> by
        closely aligning to the existing architecture and the existing
        code base. Use the <format/> defined for a task plan and inject
        the information from feature A<n/> and all derived realization
        decisions into it. Store the resulting task plan in <content/>.

    2.  Call the `timestamp(format: "yyyy-LL-dd HH:mm")` tool of the
        `ase` MCP service and use the `text` field of its response for
        <timestamp-created/> and <timestamp-modified/> information. Then
        insert the current <ase-task-id/>, <timestamp-created/>, and
        <timestamp-modified/> information and calculate the number of
        words <words/> of <content/>.

    3.  You *MUST* *save* the resulting plan content with the
        `task_save(id: <ase-task-id/>, text: <content/>)`.

    4.  Output a hint with the following <template/>:

        <template>
        ⧉ **ASE**: ◉ task: **<ase-task-id/>**, ✪ plan: **<words/>** words, ▶ status: **plan created**
        </template>

    5.  *Ask user*: Let the *user interactively choose*
        what to do as the next step.

        <expand name="user-dialog>
        Next Step: How would you like to proceed with the plan?
        DONE: Stop processing.
        EDIT: Hand processing off to editing.
        PREFLIGHT: Hand processing off to preflighting.
        IMPLEMENT: Hand processing off to implementation.
        </expand>

    6.  Check the tool <result/> and dispatch accordingly:

        -   If <result/> is `DONE` or `CANCEL`:
            Only output the following <template/> and then *STOP*.

            <template>
            ⧉ **ASE**: ◉ task: **<ase-task-id/>**, ✪ plan: **<words/>** words, ▶ status: **done**
            </template>

        -   If <result/> is `EDIT`:
            Only output the following <template/> and then use the
            `Skill` tool to invoke the `ase:ase-task-edit` skill in
            order to edit the plan. Immediately stop processing the
            current skill once the `Skill` tool was used.

            <template>
            ⧉ **ASE**: ◉ task: **<ase-task-id/>**, ✪ plan: **<words/>** words, ▶ status: **hand off to edit**
            </template>

        -   If <result/> is `PREFLIGHT`:
            Only output the following <template/> and then use the
            `Skill` tool to invoke the `ase:ase-task-preflight` skill in
            order to preflight the plan. Immediately stop processing the
            current skill once the `Skill` tool was used.

            <template>
            ⧉ **ASE**: ◉ task: **<ase-task-id/>**, ✪ plan: **<words/>** words, ▶ status: **hand off to preflight**
            </template>

        -   If <result/> is `IMPLEMENT`:
            Only output the following <template/> and then use the
            `Skill` tool to invoke the `ase:ase-task-implement` skill in
            order to implement the plan. Immediately stop processing the
            current skill once the `Skill` tool was used.

            <template>
            ⧉ **ASE**: ◉ task: **<ase-task-id/>**, ✪ plan: **<words/>** words, ▶ status: **hand off to implement**
            </template>
